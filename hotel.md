The `nltk.download` commands you mentioned are used to download various datasets and linguistic tools necessary for text analysis and natural language processing (NLP) using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library in Python. Here’s a detailed explanation of what each of these downloads does and why they are important:

### 1. `nltk.download('wordnet')`
- **Description**: Downloads WordNet, a large lexical database of English.
- **Utility**: WordNet is used for lemmatization and finding synonyms. Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run"). This is crucial for normalizing words for more accurate analysis.

### 2. `nltk.download('punkt')`
- **Description**: Downloads the Punkt tokenizer, which is a text segmentation tool.
- **Utility**: Punkt is used to split text into sentences or words (tokenization). This is essential for processing each word individually and applying text analysis techniques like lemmatization or stop word removal.

### 3. `nltk.download('stopwords')`
- **Description**: Downloads a list of stop words in various languages.
- **Utility**: Stop words are common words (like "the", "is", "in" in English) that are often filtered out in text analysis because they do not add much semantic value. By removing these words, you can focus on more meaningful terms.

### 4. `nltk.download('omw-1.4')`
- **Description**: Downloads the Open Multilingual WordNet version 1.4.
- **Utility**: OMW-1.4 is a multilingual version of WordNet that extends semantic analysis to languages other than English. This is useful if you are working with multilingual text data and need lexical resources in various languages.

### Why Are They Necessary?
For natural language processing tasks, these tools and datasets help prepare and clean text data, making subsequent analysis easier. For example:
- **Lemmatization** with `wordnet` helps to normalize words to avoid unnecessary variations.
- **Tokenization** with `punkt` allows you to process text into analyzable pieces.
- **Stop word filtering** with `stopwords` helps focus on important words in a text.
- **Multilingual analysis** with `omw-1.4` helps extend semantic analysis to multiple languages.

### Example Usage
Let's take an example where we analyze text to extract meaningful keywords while filtering out stop words and normalizing word forms. Here’s a small code snippet showing how these resources can be used:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

# Downloading necessary resources
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('omw-1.4')

# Example text
text = "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence."

# Tokenization
tokens = word_tokenize(text)

# Stop word removal
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]

# Lemmatization
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
lemmatized_tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in filtered_tokens]

print("Filtered and lemmatized tokens:", lemmatized_tokens)
```

In this example, we prepare the text for deeper analysis by removing non-significant words and normalizing word forms.

### Conclusion
These NLTK downloads are crucial preparatory steps for any text analysis. They provide you with the necessary tools to manipulate and analyze textual data effectively and meaningfully.
